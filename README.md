This infrastructure is designed to trade on multiple centralized exchanges simultaneously. It allows subscribing to various contracts across these exchanges, receiving real-time market data feeds, and placing, canceling, and updating orders seamlessly across all onboarded exchanges. Currently, the only onboarded exchange is FTX.
